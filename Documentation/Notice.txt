Project Setup

This project is built with React.js (running on a Vite development server) for the frontend, and PHP for the backend. It uses a local SQL Server database for data storage.

Prerequisites

Node.js & npm installed

PHP installed with PDO + SQLSRV drivers

SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)

Setup Instructions

Database

Open SSMS and execute the SQL queries located in the database folder to create the required database and tables.

Frontend

cd verde-rosa
npm install
npm run dev


Open the provided localhost link in your browser.

Backend

cd path/to/backend
php -S localhost:8000


Ensure the PHP server is running alongside the frontend.

Now the application should be fully functional on your local machine.
