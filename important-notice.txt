This project was Built using React.js (run on vite server) for the frontend, and for the backend,
a php built in driver was used,
and for the database, we used local database in ssms, which you need to execute the sql queries (in database folder)
before running the website
and to be able to run this project, you'll have to install php, and install its drivers (pdo+sqlsrv) for the backend built in php server

To run both servers each time
npm run dev (verde rosa folder)
open the localhost link
then 
(cd "path to backend folder")
php -S localhost:8000
